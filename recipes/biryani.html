    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Biryani is a flavorful and aromatic South Asian rice dish made by layering basmati rice with marinated meat (such as chicken, mutton, or beef), yogurt, fried onions, and a blend of spices like cardamom, cloves, cinnamon, and saffron. The meat is often marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger, and spices, then cooked with partially boiled rice. The layers are steamed together (a method called dum) to allow the flavors to meld. Garnished with fresh herbs like cilantro and mint, biryani is typically served with raita or salad.</p>
